            <h3>Customer Error 404 pages</h3>
            <p>
                Error 404 pages are used to tell the user that they are unable to reach the destinated URL or folder in which they selected when they were browsing.
                This page can either be helpful or frustrating and has a big impact on how people feel about a website. When someone is using a website, the last thing they want is
                to reach a point where there's no way forward and no solution.
                A good Error 404 page doesn't just say sorry, it also tries to explain why something went wrong. 
                Instead of making people angry and causing them to close everything and never come back, it helps them out. 
                It might suggest simple fixes, like refreshing the page or checking if they typed the web address correctly. 
                And it often gives users a way to tell the website's creators that there's a problem.
                Sometimes, these pages can show a bit of personality too. Adding humor, like Google's T-Rex "game" when there's no internet, makes the experience more fun. For example,
                it lets users play a little game while waiting. This kind of fun touch can make a website stand out, especially for the younger generation who rely a lot on the internet.
                You can also see this in the provided image of Disney's Error 404 "wreck it ralph" style. This shows a sense of humour and fits into disneys personality.
                In addition to this if it is ongoing and a page cannot be accessed there should be a way for the user to contact the website owner to have this fixed, simple issues may be that
                the directory name may have been changed or file structure has been moved around.</p>
            <div class="ErrorImage">
                <img src="../Images/404errorpage.jpg" alt="Error 404 Image">
            </div>
            <h3>Search Engine Friendly URL's</h3>
            <p>
                Search Engine Friendly UTLs are important as this is what will be shared with other users key things to consider when developing a user friendly URL is: 
                Keep it short and practical as its easier for users to understand and is useful for all browsers (meaning short URLS will fit on all devices like phones)
                Avoid things like hyphens, numbers, symbols and alternate spelling
                This will further complicate your customers ability to input the URL and would not enhance the users experience. As seen by the image below, this URL would not be a user friendly
                URL as it has hyphens and is difficult to spell which will lead to user frustration. 
                It is important to create search engine friendly URLs as is builds credibility, reliablility and defines accessability and findability. 
            </p>
            <h3>Traffic Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Website traffic analysis is like studying the numbers and patterns of how people use a website. By looking at basic data, we figure out how users interact with the 
                site. Then, we use this info to improve marketing strategies, understand user behavior, find connections between website traffic and marketing, identify problems, 
                and suggest improvements.
                Traffic analysis is all about understanding how effective website promotion and marketing is.
                This can be achieved by implementing monitoring software in your website or using third party webistes like Google Analytic.
